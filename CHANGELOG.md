<summary>Formatting Rules for Entries</summary>
Each entry should use the following format:

```markdown
- Summary of what was changed in a single line using past tense & followed by two whitespaces.  
  Issue: [#0](https://github.com/Flinesoft/BartyCrouch/issues/0) | PR: [#0](https://github.com/Flinesoft/BartyCrouch/pull/0) | Author: [Cihat Gündüz](https://github.com/Jeehut)
```

Note that at the end of the summary line, you need to add two whitespaces (`  `) for correct rendering on GitHub.

If needed, pluralize to `Tasks`, `PRs` or `Authors` and list multiple entries separated by `, `. Also, remove entries not needed in the second line.

## [3.13.0] - 2018-05-09
### Added
– Adds new sub command `lint` with multiple options.
For example you can now add this to your CI service:
```bash
bartycrouch lint -p "/path/to/code/files" -d -e
```
This will:
- [x] fail the CI if duplicate keys are found within the same file (`-d`)
- [x] fail the CI if empty values are found (`-e`)

### Added
– Adds new sub command `normalize` with multiple options.
For example you can now add this to your build script:
```bash
bartycrouch normalize -p "/path/to/code/files" -l en -d -w -h -s
```
This will:
- [x] warn against duplicate keys or fix them if it can (`-d`)
- [x] warn against empty values (`-w`)
- [x] make sure your target languages have exactly the same keys as your source language (`-h`)
- [x] sort your keys except for those without translations (`-s`)

Please have a look at the [migration guide](https://github.com/Flinesoft/BartyCrouch#migration-guides) for a flawless upgrade from version 2.x.


## [2.0.0] - 2016-04-30
### Added
- **Automatic search** for files now also possible **when using `-t`** (translate) via `-s`
### Changed
- Reworked option `-a` (auto) to take a path argument and **renamed to `-s`** (search)
### Fixed
- **Improved build times** when configured with Git root folder path
### Removed
- Translating adds missing keys by default, therefore `-c` option was dropped


## [1.5.0] - 2016-04-08
### Added
- Adds support for **adding missing keys to target translations Strings files** via the `-c` command line option.
  Note that the **undocumented previous behavior** of keeping keys in translation targets that didn't exist in translation source Strings files **was dropped**. From now on only keys that also exist in the source Strings file are kept in the target files to clean up target files. For most projects this change shouldn't have any effect.


## [1.4.0] - 2016-03-14
### Added
- Add support for automatically detecting all Storyboards/XIBs
  Thanks to this change the suggested **build script is now much shorter** and will **automatically adapt** to new Interface Builder file additions. No need to keep the build script updated anymore (for incremental change updates)!

## [1.3.0] - 2016-03-03
### Added
- Add comment Base value update support (only if structure not changed from defaults)
### Changed
- Update actual translation value if same as Base (assuming comment value is previous Base value)
  See #4 for further details on the rationale for the changes made here.


## [1.2.0] - 2016-02-29
### Added
- Add option to use Base localization values when adding new keys

## [1.1.0] - 2016-02-25
### Added
- Add support for automatic machine-translation using Microsoft Translator

## [1.0.0] - 2016-02-25
### Added
- Help messages & more by using [CommandLine](https://github.com/jatoben/CommandLine)
- Shorter argument names (`--input` or `-i`, `--output` or `-o`, `--auto` or `-a`)
- Migration Guide section for major release upgrades in README
### Changed
- Improved error handling and exit codes
- Further internal improvements
